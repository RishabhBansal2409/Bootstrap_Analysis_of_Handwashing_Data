Story behind the name 'saviour of mothers' given to Dr Ignaz Semmelweis :

In early 1840s , Dr Ignaz Semmelweis was working as a doctor at Vienna General Hospital and was worried about the increase in the 
death rate of women from the childbed fever - A deadly disease affecting women that just have given birth.

He collated a table which showed the number of women giving birth and number of women dying from the fever at the two clinics at the Vienna General Hospital for the years 1841 to 1846.Upon analyzing the data , Semmelweis saw a pattern and a question lingered in his mind.
Why is the proportion of deaths constantly so much higher in Clinic 1?.

After deep introspection , he figured out that the two clinics were identical with the exception that students were taught in the first and midwives in the second.While the midwives only tended to the women giving birth, the medical students also spent time in the autopsy rooms examining corpses.He concluded that students who came directly from the dissecting room to the maternity ward carried the infection from mothers who had died of the disease to healthy mothers.

Starting from the summer of 1847 , he ordered the students to wash their hands in a solution of chlorinated lime before each examination.Please be aware of the fact that no one knew of virus,bacteria in Vienna at that point of time.Under these procedures, the mortality rates improved and in March and August of 1848 no woman died in childbirth in his division.

The tragedy is that, despite the evidence (reduction in no of deaths) , Semmelweis' theory — that childbed fever was caused by some "substance" (what we today know as bacteria) from autopsy room corpses — was largely rejected by the medical community of Vienna and in 1849 he was forced to leave the Vienna General Hospital for good.Later,in 1865 he suffered a breakdown and was taken to a mental hospital, 
where he died.Ironically, he died of the same disease against which he had struggled all his professional life.
